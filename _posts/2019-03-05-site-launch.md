lead: "After many years of poor code management, I decided to restructure my website."

I've had a website probably since 2012 when I was applying to college. Every couple years, I would probably clean house and redesign the entire thing from the ground up. And each time I would do the same thing, copy and paste the HTML that I had written from one page and paste it to another. This was the most time consuming and unscalable thing I could have ever done.

I've had heard about Jekyll when I started using Github to host my site. For whatever reason, I was never able to get it set up properly on my machine. That is, until last week. Ever since I started working, I had been writing down these things that I learned from work or my own research and I wanted a place to store them. So I decided to finally give Jekyll another shot. 

Let me tell you, it is amazing.

To be continued.

<p> Heatstroke is a real-time physically-based volumetric renderer that is based on
    <a href="" target="blank">EA's Frostbite Engine</a>
    presented at Siggraph 2014 by Sebastien Hillaire.
    <a href="https://github.com/rms13" target="blank">Rishabh Shah</a> and I worked on this as our final project for CIS565: GPU Programming Fall 2017.
</p>
<p>
    WebGL 2.0 offers many features that weren't available in WebGL 1.0 and were indispensible for our implementation, including
    3D textures and multiple render targets.
</p>
<p>
    We developed a pipeline that was built from a clustered deferred renderer:
    <br> Shadow Mapping, G-Buffer Pass, Volumetric Pass, Final Shading and Tone Mapping.

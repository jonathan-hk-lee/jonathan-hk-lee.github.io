    This application was featured for the AI scavenger hunt event during
    <a href="http://pennteachin.org" target="blank">Penn's Teach-In</a> on March 20, 2018.

    This application is an augmented scavenger hunt that introduces participants to the wonders of aritificial intelligence.
    Participants would explore Penn's School of Engineering complex to see what the different labs Penn has to offer. Each
    location would have an image target and would provide a major milestone in artificial intelligence.

    There are two parts to this game, the scavenger hunt and Drone InvadARs, an augmented reality spin on Space Invaders. As
    players go through the hunt, they get to collect items that are used for Drone InvadARs. Players can play this at any
    time, as long as they have a
    <a href="../PennShield">Penn Shield</a> as their target.

    I utilized Unity and Vuforia which allowed me to create builds for both iOS and Android from a single project. To keep things
    simple for registration and scorekeeping, I used

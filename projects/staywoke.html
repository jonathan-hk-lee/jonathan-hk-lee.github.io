<p>
    Stay Woke is an incredibly
    <i>bear-able</i> VR experience.
</p>
<p>
    Players play as Goldilocks as she finds a way to escape the bears. The bear is a very light sleeper so even the faintest
    of footsteps can wake the bear from its slumber. If the player finds that the bear chasing them, they can use the resources
    to distract the bear, but beware of the porridge.
</p>
<p>
    The environment can also be used to hide from the bear. We implemented a line of sight algorithm for the bear so if the player
    ducks to hide in the tall grass or hides behind a tree, the bear might stop chasing the player.
</p>
<p>
    We made modifications to the VRTK API to make the VR experience unique to our game.

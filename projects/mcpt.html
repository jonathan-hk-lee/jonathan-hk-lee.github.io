<p>
    Path Tracing is a rendering technique to generate images from 3D scenes as realistically as possible. Path tracing utilizes
    an estimation method called Monte Carlo estimation to approximate the light energy for a point from an arbitrary amount
    of samples. This will allow the light contribution to converge towards a solution that solves the Light Transport Equation.

    My path tracer supports multiple importance sampling, global illumination, volumetric rendering, and BVH acceleration.
